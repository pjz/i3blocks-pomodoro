This is a simple Pomodoro app inspired by spt project and is designed to use with i3blocks.
To configure the app just add following lines to your i3blocks config:

```
[pomodoro]
command=/path/to/pomodoro
interval=1
```

A left mouse click on the app block on i3bar toggles pause.

A right mouse click resets the timer.

From the cli:
  * `/path/to/pomodoro toggle` toggles pause
  * `/path/to/pomodoro reset` toggles resets the timer
